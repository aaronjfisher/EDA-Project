COURSERA FILES
=================


* Current plan is to have 7 questions
* Each with 2 versions, one significant one not
* Questions are: Small sample (n35), medium sample (n100) (reference), large sample (n200), axis scale, labels, outlier, bestfit
* Images are in the images folder
  * Each image file has it's number, style & p-value stored in the filename
  * 1-1 and 1-2 are the two possible figures a student might see for question 1. Likewise for questions 2 through 7.


*The "alt" plan is the have 3 questions about size, and then 2 or three
where the data is the same for all people, but each person is randomized to see a different presentation style
